# emergentseas

The hotly official website for EmergentSeas, which is an umbrella for my independent theatre/art pursuits at http://emergentseas.co and blabbed about on twitter at [@_emergent_seas](http://twitter.com/_emergent_seas)

PR if you want... if I dig it.. it goes in.

It's built in Nuxt. Because.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
